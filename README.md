## Inventory Management System
This project is a simple inventory management system written in C. It allows users to add, search, update, delete, and display items in an inventory. It also includes features for identifying surplus and low stock items, calculating total inventory value, summing item quantities by category, tracking item expiry dates, and filtering items by price range.

### Features
1. Add Item: Add a new item to the inventory.
2. Search Item: Search for an item by item number, item name, or category.
3. Update Item: Update the details of an existing item.
4. Delete Item: Delete an item from the inventory.
5. Display Inventory: Display all items in the inventory.
6. Surplus Quantity Identification: Identify items with quantities above a specified amount.
7. Low Quantity Identification: Identify items with quantities below a specified amount.
8. Total Inventory Value Calculation: Calculate the total value of the inventory.
9. Item Quantity Summation by Category: Sum the quantities of items by category.
10. Item Expiry Tracking: Track items that are past their expiry dates.
11. Filter by Price: Display items within a specified price range.

### Note
1. The inventory data is stored in a text file named 'inventory.txt' in the same directory as the program.
2. Ensure that 'inventory.txt' is present in the directory or the program will create one upon adding the first item.
